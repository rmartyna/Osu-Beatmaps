### Short description

This application is used to help filter beatmaps, allowing you to download high quality maps more easily.
Note that it is heavily developed and updated weekly.

### How it works

You set some criteria such as minimum number of favourites on a map, or minimum rank of a mapper.
After that the application scrapes the site and shows you the maps that passed the evaluation test.
Then you can choose whether to download or remove beatmaps from future searches.
Note that it should be used on pending maps, since ranked maps are generally high quality.
